# Lenses for Quoting

## Introduction

This list of lenses is a work in progress. It was compiled after a client project went waaaay over budget. It was not the first time that I've underestimated a project, so I started writing a list of questions that, if I had asked myself in the beginning, perhaps would have improved the accuracy of my estimate and reduced the size of the hole in my pocket. The lenses aim to provide not-so-much a checklist as a list of triggers that will help developers (especially me) burn themselves less often.

All relevant questions aim to get you thinking about your design and your estimate, because if you don't think first and plan ahead, you may wind up shooting yourself in the foot. Some aspects will not apply to all apps, but as [@insertjokehere](https://twitter.com/insertjokehere) recently noted at a Sydney CocoaHeads meeting, most apps these days require interaction with a server and some form of local data model. 

Note that the actor of the questions vary from time to time between I, you, the app etc. This *is* a work in progress. I intend to hone it, make it better, expand it, distill it and perhaps even write a series of answers to some of the questions posed. 

It is my sincere hope that the content of these lists helps you, the developer, the project manager, the wearer of many hats, in at least some small way, to make a better and more peaceful life for yourself.

## The Lenses

There are likely many duplicates in the following lists and the categorisation is somewhat ad hoc. Pull requests are more than welcome, but I will attempt to improve them as I find different combinations of questions more beneficial.
